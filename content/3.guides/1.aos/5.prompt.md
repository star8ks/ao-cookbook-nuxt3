## Step 1: Open aos and Start the Editor

- Launch the aos command-line interface.
- Enter `.editor` to open the inline text editor.

## Step 2: Write the Custom Prompt Function

- In the editor, define your custom prompt function. For example:
  ```lua
  function Prompt()
      return "YourName@aos> "
  end
  ```
  Customize `"YourName@aos> "` to your preferred prompt text.

## Step 3: Exit and Run Your Code

- To exit the editor and execute your code, type `.done` and then press Enter.
- Your aos prompt should now display the new custom format.

## Step 4: Save for Future Use (Optional)

- If you wish to use this prompt in future aos sessions, save your script in a Lua file.
- In subsequent sessions, load this script to apply your custom prompt.

## Maximizing Your Prompt

There's a great deal of utility and creativity that can come from customizing your prompt. Several things you can do within your prompt are:

- Tracking the number of unhandled messages you have in your inbox by creating a function that shows how many messages you have.

  ```lua
    --Example:
    function Prompt()
      return "YourName Inbox: [" .. #Inbox .. "] > "
    end
  ```

- Tracking the number of members are within your process ID's chatroom.
- Tracking the balance of a specified token that your process ID holds.

## Conclusion

Now that you understand how to maximize the utility within your Prompt, you've now gained a crucial step to streamlining your ao development experience.
